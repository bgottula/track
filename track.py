class Tracker(object):
    """Main tracking loop class.

    This class is the core of the track package. A tracking loop or control
    loop is a system that uses feedback for control. In this case, the thing
    under control is a telescope mount. Slew commands are sent to the mount
    at regular intervals to keep it pointed in the direction of some object.
    In order to know which direction the mount should slew, the tracking loop
    needs feedback which comes in the form of an error signal. The error signal
    is a measure of the difference between where the telescope is pointed now
    compared to where the object is. The control loop tries to drive the error
    signal magnitude to zero. The final component in the loop is a loop filter
    ("loop controller" might be a better name, but "loop filter" is the name
    everyone uses). The loop filter controls the response characteristics of
    the system including the bandwidth (responsiveness to changes in input)
    and the damping factor.

    Attributes:
        loop_filter: A dict with keys 'az' and 'alt' where the values are
            LoopFilter objects. Each axis has its own independent loop filter.
        mount: An object of type TelescopeMount. This represents the interface
            to the mount.
        error_source: An object of type ErrorSource. The error can be computed
            in many ways so an abstract class with a generic interface is used.
        error: Cached error value returned by the error_source object's
            compute_error() method. This is cached so that callback methods
            can make use of it if needed. A dict with keys 'az' and 'alt'.
        slew_rate: Cached slew rates from the most recent loop filter output.
            Cached to make it available to callbacks. A dict with keys 'az' and
            'alt'.
        num_iterations: A running count of the number of iterations.
        callback: A callback function. The callback will be called once at the
            end of every control loop iteration. Set to None if no callback is
            registered.
        stop: Boolean value. The control loop checks this on every iteration
