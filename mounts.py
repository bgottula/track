    """Interface class to facilitate tracking with NexStar telescopes.

    This class implements the abstract methods in the TelescopeMount base
    class. The interface to the NexStar hand controller is provided by
    the nexstar package.

    Attributes:
        nexstar: A nexstar.NexStar object which abstracts the low-level serial
            command interface to the NexStar hand controller.
        alt_min_limit: Lower limit on the mount's altitude, which can be used
            to prevent the optical tube from colliding with the mount. Limit
            is enforced during calls to slew().
        alt_max_limit: Upper limit on the mount's altitude, which can be used
            to prevent the optical tube from colliding with the mount. Limit
            is enforced during calls to slew().
        max_slew_rate: Maximum slew rate supported by the mount in degrees per
            second.
        last_slew_dir: A dict storing the directions of the last commanded 
            slews in each axis. Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. Values are +1 when
            the last slew was in the positive direction and -1 when the last
            slew was in the negative direction. The values may be either +1 
            or -1 after class construction or when the last slew has rate 0.
        backlash: A dict storing the magnitudes of the backlash in each axis.
            Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. The values have units of degrees and are
            non-negative.
        aligned_slew_dir: A dict storing the final approach direction used
            during alignment on each axis. Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. Values 
            are +1 to indicate that the final approach slew was in the positive
            direction or -1 to indicate the opposite.
