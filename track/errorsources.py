"""error sources for use in telescope tracking control loop.

The errorsources module provides classes that derive from the abstract ErrorSource class. Each
class defines a method compute_error() which returns an error vector representing the difference
between the current position and some measure of the ideal position. This information might come
from ephemeris data for a celestial or man-made object, a camera, or even human input. Error source
classes can also be designed to compute an error vector by combining data from multiple sources
or by intelligently switching between sources.
