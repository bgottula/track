class Tracker(TelemSource):
    """Main tracking loop class.

    This class is the core of the track package. It forms a closed-loop control system. The thing
    under control is a telescope mount. Slew commands are sent to the mount at regular intervals to
    keep it pointed in the direction of some target object. In order to know which direction and
    speed the mount should slew, the system needs feedback which comes in the form of an error
    signal. The error signal is a measure of the difference between where the target object is and
    where the telescope is pointed now. The control loop tries to drive the error signal magnitude
    to zero. The final component in the loop is a PID controller which has adjustable gains that
    are tuned to optimize the response characteristics of the system such as steady-state error,
    tracking noise, and how long it takes for the mount to reach small pointing error when slewing
    to a new target.

    Since there are two axes in the telescope mount this class really contains two control systems,
    one for each mount axis. For each axis, the error terms, controller, and mount actuation are
    in terms of the encoder and slew rate associated with that mount axis. In some cases it is
    most natural to think of pointing error and positions in terms of celestial coordiante systems
    such as topocentric (azimuth and altitude) or equatorial (right ascension and declination), but
    these coordinates must be transformed to axis encoder positions for use in this control system.

    Attributes:
        controller: A dict with keys for each axis where the values are LoopController objects.
            Each mount axis has its own independent controller.
        mount: An object of type TelescopeMount. This represents the interface to the mount.
        error_source: An object of type ErrorSource. The error can be computed in many ways so an
            abstract class with a generic interface is used.
        error: Cached error value returned by the error_source object's compute_error() method.
            This is cached so that callback methods can make use of it if needed. A dict with keys
            for each axis.
        slew_rate: Cached slew rates from the most recent loop filter output. Cached to make it
            available to callbacks. A dict with keys for each axis.
        num_iterations: A running count of the number of iterations.
        callback: A callback function. The callback will be called during every control loop
            iteration. None if no callback is registered.
        stop: Boolean value. The control loop checks this on every iteration and stops if the
            value is True.
