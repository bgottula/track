        mount: A point.NexStar object which abstracts the low-level serial
            command interface to the NexStar hand controller.
        alt_min_limit: Lower limit on the mount's altitude, which can be used
            to prevent the optical tube from colliding with the mount. Limit
            is enforced during calls to slew().
        alt_max_limit: Upper limit on the mount's altitude, which can be used
            to prevent the optical tube from colliding with the mount. Limit
            is enforced during calls to slew().
        max_slew_rate: Maximum slew rate supported by the mount in degrees per
            second.
        last_slew_dir: A dict storing the directions of the last commanded
            slews in each axis. Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. Values are +1 when
            the last slew was in the positive direction and -1 when the last
            slew was in the negative direction. The values may be either +1
            or -1 after class construction or when the last slew has rate 0.
        backlash: A dict storing the magnitudes of the backlash in each axis.
            Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. The values have units of degrees and are
            non-negative.
        aligned_slew_dir: A dict storing the final approach direction used
            during alignment on each axis. Keys are 'az' and 'alt'. Values
            are +1 to indicate that the final approach slew was in the positive
            direction or -1 to indicate the opposite.
